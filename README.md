## Zotero Integration

A tool for synchronizing zotero literatures into my own knowledge vault in Silverbullet.

## Usage

Use the `litsync` command to manage your literature:

```bash
# Synchronize your literature
litsync

# Search through items using fzf
litsync search  # or simply: litsync s
```
